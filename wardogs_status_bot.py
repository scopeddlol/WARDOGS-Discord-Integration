"""Watches for the Wardogs pause-menu server info on screen and mirrors it
into a single Discord message that gets edited in place (in a channel where
only the bot can post, so it's always the one message there). Editing avoids
Discord's much stricter per-channel rename rate limit (~2/10min) and doesn't
spam notifications the way a new message each time would.

Setup: copy .env.example to .env and fill in DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN and
DISCORD_STATUS_CHANNEL_ID (see README.md for how to get both).

Usage:
    python wardogs_status_bot.py            run with a system tray icon
                                              (this is what runs hidden at
                                              login - see README "Run in
                                              the background")
    python wardogs_status_bot.py --once      capture+OCR+parse once and print
                                              the result (no Discord call,
                                              no game-running check) - use
                                              this while sitting in the
                                              pause menu to tune CAPTURE_REGION
    python wardogs_status_bot.py --dry-run   run continuously in the console,
                                              logging what it would do instead
                                              of calling Discord
    python wardogs_status_bot.py --no-tray   run continuously in the console,
                                              calling Discord as normal, but
                                              without the tray icon
